This is a team project we developed in the first year of university. 
We designed a Golf Simulator in Java with AI bots that can play the game automatically.
While this was a team effort including 6 students, I contributed to the collision system, ball bouncing mechanics, mouse inputs to push the ball, parts of GUI design, and the software architecture.
I made sure that all dependencies are separated and enforced the use of programming patterns.
